# Bouc-Wen-class-model

## Overview
This script provides a Bouc-Wen class model considering hysteresis mechanism of RC columns.
'Example' folder contains one .m script and two .mat files.
>'BoucWen.m' implements the algorithm offered in the appendix of the reference.
>'demo.m' offers a demonstration for the model by comparing the experimental data and the model
