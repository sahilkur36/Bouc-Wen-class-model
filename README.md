# Bouc-Wen-class-model

# Overview
This script provides a Bouc-Wen class model considering hysteresis mechanism of RC columns. 
BoucWen.m implements the algorithm offered in the appendix of the reference.
Example folder contains one .m script and two .mat files.
You may find a demonstration of the Bouc-Wen class model by running demo.m in the Example folder.
