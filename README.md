# Bouc-Wen-class-model

## Overview
This package is about the Bouc-Wen class model considering hysteresis mechanism of RC columns.<br/>
`BoucWen.m` returns the corresponding force vector provided with a displacement vector using the proposed Bouc-Wen class model. It implements the algorithm offered in the appendix of the reference.<br/>
`Example` folder contains one .m script (`demo.m`) and two .mat files (`experimental data.mat` & `params.mat`).<br/>
`demo.m` offers a demonstration for the model by comparing the experimental data and the model
